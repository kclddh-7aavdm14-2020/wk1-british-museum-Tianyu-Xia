        When I visited the British Museum Website, the first section I visited was the '14 things not to miss at Museum' which I think is the most central part of the museum. Furthermore, what interests me most is The Parthenon Sculptures. I had heard stories about the Parthenon in books, so I was very curious about it. And as I was browsing the British Museum, I was fascinated by the Parthenon's magnificent architectures. The Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens has a very long history and was built between 447 and 438 BC as a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena Parthenos. The Parthenon is a symbol of history, depicting many Greek mythological storylines, for example the battle of the Centaurs and Lapiths, the famous head of a horse of Selene (the moon goddess) and the river god Ilissos. I used to read some Greek mythology stories when I was a kid, so when I saw these structures, it was easy to associate them with Greek mythological characters. In addition to the Parthenon architectures, the Rosetta Stone, Bust of Ramesses the Great, Tree of Life, Edmund de Waal library of exile, and Hoa Hakananai'a are all valuable collections in the British Museum. I can't wait to go to London to browse these wonderful collections in the British Museum.
<p>At the same time, the British Museum Website also give us a chance to take a virtual gallery tour by using Google Street View. It was so amazing, we can walk around the gallery and browse through it like what we did in the British Museum before. When we are interested in a collection, we can click on the name at the bottom of the map and its introduction will be displayed. What an amazing tour on the British Museum Website, I really like it!</p>
